                As the name suggests, this is Tic-tac-toe, coded in 4.5 million lines of code (But its a little more complicated than that).
                <br><br>
                This was created for KinghtHacks 2023, with the goat of winning the "Frying Pan Award", which was awarded to the team with the most bizzare/useless/crazy project.
                The project is a tic-tac-toe recreation of this image:

                <div class="centered">
                    <img src="../images/chess.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <div class="split">

                    <div class="item">
                        The actual project was a .c file tasked with generating a tic tac toe program that did not use loops.
                        We did however, use while loops to ensure the game didn't end if the user made a mistake.
                        A fraction of the result can be seen on the right. (an array of values represents the board so that the file is not unmanageably large)

                    </div>

                    <div class="item">
                        <img src="../images/tac.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    
                </div>

                The resulting game of tic tac toe, was 4.5 Million lines of code long, about 100GB of storage, and was so large, that gcc could not compile it into an executable file.
                Please, do not run the code, which is provided below.
